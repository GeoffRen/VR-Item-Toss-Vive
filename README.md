The point of the game is to throw as many objects, consecutively, into the bucket as possible. Every consecutive made throw will increment your score byy one. Missing a shot will reset your score back to zero. You throw the object by making a throwing motion and clicking the trigger. While the object is being thrown, if you click the trigger again, the object will teleport back to whichever hand clicked the trigger. This also allows you to switch with what hand you hold the object with. Your current score and your current high score for the current difficulty setting are displayed behind the bucket.

There is a wind component to this game. Every shot, the force of the wind will randomize. The wind will either blow left or right. At the top of your screen there is an arrow that points in what direction the wind is blowing. There is also a number that represents with what force the wind blows.

Clicking the grip will bring up the Pause menu.
